-Most business transactions or information inquiries involve dealing with a simulated person.
*I think this is already true. Most of my transactions take place without a person being involved.*

-Nanotechnology is more capable and is in use for specialized applications, yet it has not yet made it into the mainstream. "Nanoengineered machines" begin to be used in manufacturing.
*This also seems spot-on.  The body of the 787 is molecularly engineered carbon fiber for example, but most planes are still aluminum.*

-Language translating machines are of much higher quality, and are routinely used in conversations.
*Way ahead on this one. Robot translation is amazing. I use Google translate to send emails to colleagues in Spanish and they are impressed with my Spanish writing skills.  There's a $5 augmented reality app that lets you point your phone at a Chinese sign and it displays the sign in English.*

-Just as visual- and auditory virtual reality have come of age, haptic technology has fully matured and is completely convincing, yet requires the user to enter a V.R. booth. It is commonly used for computer sex. It is the preferred sexual medium since it is safe and enhances the experience.
*Convincing VR is available right now.  Two years ago it still seemed intractable. I don't know if we'll have good haptics by the end of 2019, but I'll have to wait until 2018 to judge the feasibility of this one.*

-The vast majority of business interactions occur between humans and simulated retailers, or between a human's virtual personal assistant and a simulated retailer.
*Sure. Again, I'd say that Amazon already counts, but in 5.5 years, doesn't seem hard to believe at all.*

-Household robots are ubiquitous and reliable
*Robot doesn't necessarily mean "humanoid robot. Roomba already meets this definition. Roomba isn't a big deal, but in 5.5 years there will probably be some others.  My Nest thermostat knows when I'm home and learns my behavior.  That comes close to being a robot right now.*

-Computers do most of the vehicle drivingâ€”-humans are in fact prohibited from driving on highways unassisted.
*Most seems pretty unlikely.  It's not unlikely that there will be robot-only-lanes somewhere by the end of 2019, so I expect this one to be half-right, with impressive, surprising progress still made on the wrong half.*

-Humans are beginning to have deep relationships with automated personalities, which hold some advantages over human partners. The depth of some computer personalities convinces some people that they should be accorded more rights.
*Maybe. Let's see.  People get addicted to video games right now.  With three more cycles of Moore's Law and common, cheap VR by 2019, I'll have to wait and see.  It wouldn't surprise me if this was true or a very near miss.*

-Human-robot relationships begin as simulated personalities become more convincing.
*Same as above. There's already a rush of people working on simulated VR sex and it's going to be available in 2015.  Four years after that, who knows?*

*Overall, I'm pretty impressed with this list. I'm more of a Kurzweil critic than fan-boy, but if these are the "ridiculous" claims, I'm damn impressed.*
